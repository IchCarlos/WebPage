        <p class="ref"> <q>It is an act too often neglected,</q> said the fox. <q>It means to establish <span class="high">ties</span>.</q></p>

        <p class="ref"> <q>Just that,</q> said the fox. <q>To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world....</q></p>

        <p class="ref"><q>You're beautiful, but you're empty...One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered. Since she's the one I put under glass, since she's the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies).<span class="high"> Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose</span>.</q></p>

But you have hair the color of gold. So it will be wonderful, once you've tamed me! <span class="high">The wheat, which is golden, will remind me of you. And I'll love the sound of the wind in the wheat...</span></q></p>
